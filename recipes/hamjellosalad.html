        <h4>Ham Jell-O Salad</h4>
        <p>A savory Jell-O dish made with ham, cabbage, mayonnaise, and brown mustard. </p>
        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (3 ounce) package lemon-flavored gelatin mix (such as Jell-O)</li>
            <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple in juice, drained and juice reserved</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cold water, or as needed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons spicy brown mustard, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup finely chopped cabbage</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped celery</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped cooked ham</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Dissolve lemon gelatin in boiling water in a large bowl. Pour reserved pineapple juice and white wine vinegar into a measuring cup; add enough cold water to measure 1 cup. Stir water-juice mixture into gelatin mixture; refrigerate until cold and beginning to set, about 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir mayonnaise and spicy brown mustard together in a bowl; whisk mayonnaise mixture into cooled lemon gelatin mixture until smooth. Gently fold cabbage, ham, celery, and reserved pineapple into gelatin. Transfer mixture into a ring-shaped gelatin mold.</li>
<li>Chill in the refrigerator until firmly set, about 4 hours.</li>
<li>To serve, dip the gelatin mold into hot water to loosen the sides; place a plate on top of the mold, invert, and gently lift the mold from salad.</li>
